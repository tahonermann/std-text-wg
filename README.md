# Informal C++ Text Working Group
This repository tracks papers, projects, meeting minutes, notes, and other artifacts created by and for a group of programmers working informally on improving C++ standards support for Unicode and text processing in general.

If you would like to contribute to the discussion, please join us on [<img src="http://slack.com/favicon.ico" height="16"/>Slack](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16-unicode) at https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16-unicode or [<img src="https://groups.google.com/forum/favicon.ico" height="16"/>Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/std-text-wg) at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/std-text-wg.

- Papers and projects currently under our purview:
  - ~~[P0169: regex with Unicode character types](http://wg21.link/p0169)~~
    (Not being advocated at this time; more foundational concerns need to be addressed first)
  - [P0244: Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library](http://wg21.link/p0244)
  - [P0353: Unicode Friendly Encoding Conversions for the Standard Library](http://wg21.link/p0353)
