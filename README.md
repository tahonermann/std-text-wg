# Informal C++ Text Working Group
The std-text-wg working group has evolved into the official WG21 SG16 study group and our work is now tracked by the [sg16-unicode GitHub organization](https://github.com/sg16-unicode).  This repository has been retired; the [sg16](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16) and [sg16-meetings](https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings) repositories now track content previously tracked here.
